Tensorflow
___
Program takes a .png image as input and gives the user an option to encode either user generated or computer generated text.

If user enters text, the text is encoded into the image and a copy is created with the encoded text.

If user chooses for the program to generate text, a string is generated using the keras model and the previous steps are followed.
___
The program could be enhanced by using a more complex steganography algorithim in order to make decoding more difficult

The encoding  may cause minor discoloration in certain types of images, such as predominantly white/black images

The program only works with .PNG image types

___
The program has potential applications in security, an image could be encoded with a password and could be used in liu of a password

If the user requires it, a model trained on strong passwords could generate such a password for the user.
